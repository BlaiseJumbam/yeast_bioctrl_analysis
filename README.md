## Biocontrol of gray mold and ripe rot pathogens using non-Saccharomyces yeasts
Here I share data, results, and analysis code for a project I did on yeast biocontrol of gray mold and ripe rot pathogens at the University of Maryland, College Park. 
We did confrontation, pathogen on yeast and double plate assays.
We also tested the yeast on spore germination of the pathogens.
In vivo assays were done using organic table grapes purchased from a local store.
Yeast that showed control potentials were then investigated for a second role as fermentation starters using grape juice.
